## **Project 1: AirLineFinal**

- **Business Goal**: Improve airline operational efficiency by identifying patterns in delays and cancellations.  
- **Data Source**: U.S. Department of Transportation flight records.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature Engineering (e.g., weather, airport codes)  
  - K-Means Clustering and Trend Analysis  
- **Outcome**: Key delay patterns by airline and airport identified, enabling optimization of schedules and resource planning.

## **Project 2: Final Shark Tank**

- **Business Goal**: Analyze startup pitches to identify success factors in securing Shark Tank investments.  
- **Data Source**: Manually curated dataset from Shark Tank episodes.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) on pitch descriptions  
  - Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)  
  - Business Category Segmentation and ROI Analysis  
- **Outcome**: Mapped key attributes that increased the likelihood of funding, such as equity offered and pitch language sentiment.

## **Project 3: Diamonds**

- **Business Goal**: Build a predictive model to estimate diamond prices for valuation and market comparison.  
- **Data Source**: Public diamond dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or Râ€™s ggplot2).  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression  
  - Feature Engineering on categorical (cut, clarity) and continuous variables  
  - Data Visualization for price distribution insights  
- **Outcome**: Achieved high-accuracy pricing predictions, delivering tools for retail pricing optimization.
